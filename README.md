# Blackjack with Virutal Interface
### Team Members: Dawson Crowley, Sam Schmidt, Cole Swanson, George Venzke 

This is the user interface for the virtual black jack player and dealer screen supplying instructions.

The system will use a display screen to notify a player when to deal cards. A virtual user interface allows remote players to join, place bets, and interact with the game in real time. The system will be equipped with sensors and wireless connectivity to track card movements and update the virtual platform accordingly.
